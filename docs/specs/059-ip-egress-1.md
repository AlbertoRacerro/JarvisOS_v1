# 059 — IP-EGRESS-1: sensitivity, retrieval, and external-boundary enforcement

Status: proposed maintainer amendment reconciled with accepted ADR-059; runtime remains blocked behind 059b; `docs/specs/STATUS.md` is authoritative.

Depends on: 003, 015, 018, 021, 040, 042

## Binding maintainer direction — 2026-07-12

This definition records the maintainer-approved target policy that external provider
calls should normally use a server-owned policy autopilot and that human
confirmation should be exceptional rather than required for every call.

ADR-059 is accepted and explicitly supersedes only ADR-057's per-call confirmation
sentence. It supplies durable authority for silent effective-S0/S1 allow when no
configured trigger fires and for exact-packet confirmation when a configured trigger
requires it. This definition remains planning-only: 059b stays blocked until its
full implementation specification is reconciled and explicitly promoted through
the normal registry ladder. Implementation work may begin after promotion to
`ready`; policy-autopilot runtime activation and real external execution remain
blocked until the implementation PR is reviewed and merged.

The maintainer explicitly accepts the residual risk that an automatically sanitized
S2/S3-derived representation may still retain some project-specific information.
Prototype velocity takes priority over exhaustive IP protection. This accepted risk
changes target policy defaults and ceremony, not the execution-spine mechanics.

The target amendment does not weaken these invariants:

- every AI call, including a model-backed local sanitizer, passes through
  `run_ai_task` and writes an `ai_jobs` row;
- only a strictly deterministic non-model transformation may run without an AI
  call;
- models, frontend code, and request fields may recommend but never authorize a
  provider route, budget, permission, sensitivity downgrade, or state change;
- exact packet construction, policy decisions, provider/model binding, and fallback
  checks are server-owned;
- safe defaults remain paid AI disabled, budget zero, and fake provider;
- `route_class="auto"` remains local-only; policy autopilot resolves an explicit
  external route before execution;
- raw S4 and any final or derived content that remains secret-bearing never leaves
  JarvisOS;
- monthly hard-budget denial cannot be confirmed away.

Spec 059a was merged through PR #90 and is the unchanged substrate for this target
policy. In particular, external eligibility remains strictly effective S0/S1.
059b must build on that rule rather than reopening or bypassing it.

## Goal

Under accepted ADR-059, define one fail-closed, server-owned boundary that decides
whether the **exact outbound packet** for an external provider may leave JarvisOS.
The boundary becomes runtime only through a reconciled, promoted, reviewed, and
merged 059b implementation.

The intended normal path is:

1. select the minimum necessary context;
2. classify current sources using the merged 059a labels, derivatives, floors, and
   stale-state rules;
3. automatically sanitize eligible S2/S3/unknown sources locally;
4. require the resulting outbound representation to be effectively S0 or S1;
5. construct and digest the exact packet;
6. apply egress, projected-economic, credential, provider, and trigger policy;
7. silently allow the packet when no configured confirmation trigger fires;
8. execute through the shared spine and record the decision and call.

The boundary runs immediately before every concrete provider attempt, including
each fallback. A model, route label, request body, caller-supplied confirmation flag,
or provider response cannot authorize egress or lower sensitivity.

## Current runtime facts that bind this definition

1. `run_ai_task` is the shared AI execution spine for local and external model calls.
2. `evaluate_alpha_execution_gate(...)` governs provider, credential, usage, and
   cost state but does not own IP sensitivity, sanitization, exact-packet binding,
   or confirmation-ticket integrity.
3. Explicit external routes and manual context currently lack one final exact-packet
   egress decision immediately before adapter invocation.
4. The merged 059a implementation provides digest-bound labels and derivatives,
   deterministic floors, stale handling, sensitivity-aware selection, and
   read-only included/withheld previews.
5. 059a permits only effective S0/S1 records or derivatives in external previews.
   Approved S2 derivatives remain internal-only.
6. 059a allows an S4-source derivative only when the derivative is effective S0/S1
   and no secret-bearing content survives; the source label alone is not a permanent
   ban on a properly sanitized derivative.
7. Auto sensitivity classification remains advisory. Deterministic policy is
   authoritative.
8. The legacy escalation-confirm path accepts client-supplied outbound text, route,
   and token metadata. 059b must replace this trust with server-loaded packet state.
9. Unsupported external-tool operations deny by default; 059 does not create an
   external-tool runtime.
10. Conversation history is not yet a separate authority or egress path. Future
    history must enter through the same context and packet contracts.
11. ADR-059 has superseded ADR-057's per-call confirmation sentence. This definition
    records the aligned policy but does not itself activate autopilot runtime.

## Canonical sensitivity taxonomy

| Level | Existing meaning | Raw external rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `S0` | public | target policy permits silent allow when all other gates pass and no trigger fires |
| `S1` | internal/non-proprietary | target policy permits silent allow when all other gates pass and no trigger fires |
| `S2` | confidential/private project material | raw denied; derivative path only; final external representation must be S0/S1 |
| `S3` | proprietary or sensitive IP | raw denied; derivative path only; final external representation must be S0/S1 |
| `S4` | credentials, private keys, tokens, passwords, equivalent secret material | raw denied; no surviving secret-bearing content may leave; an S4-source derivative is eligible only under the strict S0/S1 rule below |

`unknown` is not a permissive sixth level. It is treated at least as restrictive as
S3 for raw egress and enters the local sanitization/review path. It is never sent
raw.

### Final-level rules

- JarvisOS computes the most restrictive applicable level.
- Deterministic credential/secret evidence floors to S4.
- Explicit proprietary/IP evidence floors to S3.
- Explicit private/confidential evidence floors to S2.
- Model hints and caller labels may raise but never lower the final level.
- Missing, stale, malformed, or policy-version-mismatched authority becomes
  `unknown` for external use.
- A source once classified S2/S3/S4 cannot be downgraded in place; a lower-level
  representation is a separate derivative with immutable provenance.
- A derivative from an S4-labelled source may be externally eligible only when it
  is current, provenance-bound, effective S0/S1, all deterministic checks show no
  secret survives, and every other gate passes.
- `STRICT_IP` retains fail-closed unknown handling.
- `FAST_DEV` may retain the existing bounded S1 default only for ordinary prompt
  text with no attached project/manual context and no hard marker.
- `DISABLED` continues to deny AI execution.

## 059a substrate: labels and derivatives

059a is merged and remains authoritative for:

- normalized `<kind>:<id>` subject references;
- labels bound to workspace, source content digest, level, policy version,
  classification source, actor/reviewer, timestamp, and prior-label chain;
- deterministic floors and causal latest-label resolution;
- immutable derivative identity, source references/digests, content digest,
  effective level, transformations, reviewer, policy version, and lifecycle state;
- stale/revoked/source-missing/policy-mismatch behavior;
- coherent SQLite read snapshots for selection and eligibility;
- read-only preview and ordinary derivative reads;
- explicit revalidation for persisted stale transitions;
- effective S0/S1-only external preview eligibility;
- S4-source derivatives only when the resulting derivative is effective S0/S1 and
  no secret-bearing material survives.

The derivative `reviewer` field is an actor/provenance field. A value such as
`policy-sanitizer-vN` is valid for an automatically approved derivative and binds
the exact sanitizer policy/version; it need not identify a human.

## Automatic sanitization

S2, S3, and `unknown` sources may become external-eligible only through a
provenance-preserving local pipeline:

1. load current source content and 059a authority in one coherent read snapshot;
2. apply deterministic floors and context minimization;
3. run either a strictly deterministic non-model transformation or a model-backed
   rewrite/abstraction sanitizer through `run_ai_task` on an explicit local route,
   producing its own `ai_jobs` row;
4. run deterministic secret and IP scans before and after rewriting;
5. recompute content digest and effective level;
6. persist source digests, sanitizer/model/config version, transformations,
   `reviewer = policy-sanitizer-vN`, approval state, and policy version;
7. fail closed on malformed output, stale source, missing provenance, scan failure,
   surviving secret evidence, or any final level above S1.

Raw S2/S3/unknown never enters an external packet. Raw S4 and any final or derived
content that remains S4 or secret-bearing are denied with no override.

An S4-source derivative is not denied merely because its source was S4. Consistent
with merged 059a, it may become externally eligible only when current,
provenance-bound, effective S0/S1, secret-free under deterministic checks, and
allowed by every other gate.

An effectively S0/S1 derivative may be auto-approved and may follow the target
silent policy autopilot. A result that remains S2/S3 is **not** externally eligible
and cannot be made eligible by confirmation. It invokes trigger `t3`, which pauses
for review, requires another sanitization pass, or remains local.

Sanitizer model output and schema validity have no authority. Deterministic scans
are guardrails, not proof of semantic IP removal.

## Sampled human audit

Human review is sampled rather than required for every automatically approved
derivative:

- default sample: 5% of auto-approved derivatives per calendar week;
- selection, sample cohort, and policy version are deterministic and auditable;
- sampled rejection revokes the derivative, logs a sanitizer failure, and blocks
  reuse;
- policy may increase sampling or require full review by workspace, provider family,
  task kind, recent failure window, or explicit `ask_me` preference;
- reducing the default below 5% requires a separate maintainer decision.

## Context minimization

- Never place an entire workspace, conversation archive, vault, or corpus in one
  packet.
- Every block carries server-owned source/derivative identity and digest.
- Configuration defines fail-closed per-packet count and serialized-size caps for
  blocks derived from S2/S3/unknown sources.
- Explicit IDs, model requests, and task requests never bypass these caps.
- Sensitivity withholding and policy caps occur before serialization.
- Token-budget truncation occurs afterward, with withheld, sanitizer-failed,
  policy-capped, and budget-dropped reasons kept distinct.
- Packet manifests partition outbound blocks and preserve derivative `source_refs`;
  they are not assumed to map one-to-one to selected raw rows.

Provider-family diversification is a separate planned follow-up. It may route
families of derived content across provider accounts, but it may not weaken packet,
budget, sensitivity, or audit gates.

## Exact outbound packet

Before any network attempt, JarvisOS constructs one canonical `EgressPacket`
containing at least:

- exact user prompt or approved prompt derivative;
- exact included context blocks;
- included, withheld, sanitizer-failed, policy-capped, and budget-dropped manifests;
- source/derivative IDs and current digests;
- explicit route and concrete provider/model binding;
- task kind and server-sized token limit;
- sensitivity, sanitizer, trigger, and policy versions;
- final effective level.

The packet has a canonical SHA-256 digest. Any change to content, source state,
derivative, route, provider/model, token sizing, policy version, or trigger state
creates a new digest and invalidates any prior decision or ticket.

Raw S2/S3/S4, unknown content, effective S2/S3 derivatives, and any surviving
secret-bearing content must never be serialized into an externally eligible packet.
A current secret-free effective S0/S1 derivative from an S4 source is not classified
as raw S4 content. Logs contain digests and safe metadata only.

## Egress decision

Add an immutable, server-owned `EgressDecision` containing at least:

- result (`allow`, `deny`, or `pause`);
- deterministic reason code;
- operation (`external_provider_call`; unsupported operations deny);
- explicit route, concrete provider ID, and model ID;
- prompt level, maximum context level, and final effective level;
- packet digest;
- included, withheld, derivative, sanitizer-failed, and policy-capped counts;
- policy/sanitizer/trigger versions;
- confirmation requirement, trigger IDs, and ticket ID where present.

For every concrete external network binding, including every fallback,
`run_ai_task` must require both:

1. a current projected economic/provider/credential approval; and
2. an allowed exact-packet egress decision for that concrete provider/model.

Approval for one binding does not authorize another. Fallbacks are independently
reconstructed and re-evaluated. A model-backed local sanitizer is a separate
`run_ai_task` call with a local route and `ai_jobs` row; it does not receive external
egress permission and cannot authorize its output.

## Target policy autopilot

ADR-059 supersedes the conflicting ADR-057 sentence. A packet whose included
blocks are all effectively S0/S1 receives a silent server-owned `allow` when all
other gates pass and no confirmation trigger fires. Silent allows still write
decision and execution ledger rows; they create no confirmation ticket.

ADR-059 supplies durable policy authority, but this section does not itself activate
policy autopilot. After 059b is reconciled and promoted to `ready`, implementation
work may begin; policy-autopilot runtime activation and real external execution
remain blocked until the implementation PR is reviewed and merged.

The trigger list is configuration data, not scattered code constants:

| ID | Trigger | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t1` | first use of a provider/model pair | exact-packet confirmation |
| `t2` | projected call crosses the daily spend soft threshold | exact-packet confirmation; monthly hard budget remains final |
| `t3` | sanitization pipeline failure or deterministic S2/S3/S4 floor on sanitized output | pause and create review/resanitization work; no externally eligible packet exists until the final output is S0/S1 |
| `t4` | unsupported or unknown egress operation | deny; confirmation cannot invent a runtime |
| `t5` | explicit per-workspace `ask_me` flag | exact-packet confirmation for an otherwise eligible S0/S1 packet |

Unknown, missing, or malformed trigger configuration fails closed. Surviving S4 or
secret-bearing content, monthly hard-budget exhaustion, missing credentials, stale
provenance, final level above S1, and unsupported mechanics are non-confirmable
denials or pauses.

## Confirmation and replay prevention

A single-use confirmation ticket exists only when an otherwise eligible packet
triggers `t1`, `t2`, or `t5` (or another future explicitly configured confirmable
trigger approved by a later spec).

The lifecycle is:

1. proposal creation stores the exact eligible packet, packet digest, fixed target
   set, trigger IDs, source/derivative digests, policy versions, proposal AI job ID,
   and expiry;
2. the client receives only safe metadata, ticket ID, and packet digest;
3. confirmation identifies the ticket; the server reloads all authoritative state;
4. current source/derivative digests, policy, target, credential, and projected
   budget state are revalidated;
5. one `allow_once` authorization is atomically consumed immediately before the
   adapter call;
6. provider failure still consumes it;
7. replay, mutation, expiry, revocation, staleness, target mismatch, or policy drift
   yields zero adapter calls.

The legacy confirmation request may remain temporarily only as an identifier
carrier. Client-supplied text, route, provider, model, token, digest, and boolean
confirmation fields are ignored or rejected.

## Ledger and provenance

No prompt, source body, derivative body, credential, or authorization header is
added to `ai_jobs` or events.

Safe metadata includes:

- egress decision and ticket IDs;
- packet and derivative digests;
- effective level;
- source/manifests counts;
- sanitizer task `ai_jobs` ID when a model-backed sanitizer is used;
- sanitizer, policy, sampling, and trigger versions;
- deterministic allow/deny/pause reason;
- concrete provider/model and fallback-attempt index;
- bounded usage/cost fields.

A denied or paused request writes a normal pre-provider ledger row and makes zero
external network adapter calls.

## Delivery split

### 059a — sensitivity and context foundation

Merged through PR #90. It owns labels, derivatives, deterministic floors,
staleness, coherent context selection, read-only preview, S4-source derivative
rules, and S0/S1-only external eligibility. This amendment does not modify that
implementation.

### 059b — policy autopilot and execution enforcement

With this definition amendment and ADR-059 merged and reconciled, 059b owns the
following implementation scope after its full specification is reconciled and
promoted through the normal ladder:

- deterministic or AI-spine-routed automatic sanitizer orchestration;
- sampled human-audit queue and revocation behavior;
- S2/S3/unknown-derived packet caps;
- canonical packet and immutable decision;
- silent S0/S1 allow;
- configured trigger evaluation;
- single-use tickets for confirmable triggers;
- projected economic re-checks;
- removal of client-trusted escalation data;
- per-fallback spine enforcement;
- safe ledger evidence and mutation-resistant tests.

059b follows the normal backlog row → kernel/full-spec → implementation ladder.

## Files expected to change

Verify paths against current `master`; do not create parallel gateways or stores.
Likely 059b surface:

- one bounded egress-policy module under `backend/app/modules/ai/`;
- the existing 059a sensitivity/derivative services only through public contracts;
- `backend/app/modules/ai/execution.py`;
- `backend/app/modules/ai/escalations.py`;
- `backend/app/modules/ai/budget.py` for projected-call checks;
- AI request/response models and routes for safe decision/ticket contracts;
- `backend/app/modules/ai/routing/bridge.py` only for advisory proposal metadata;
- focused tests and one implementation report.

Provider adapters, BLUECAD product callers, frontend, conversation runtime, vector
stores, worker infrastructure, and unrelated runner/solver code remain unchanged
unless a concrete shared-spine defect requires a bounded correction.

## Required 059b tests

- S0/S1 no-trigger packet silently allows and creates no ticket under ADR-059
  authority;
- each trigger is configuration-driven and independently tested;
- missing/malformed policy or trigger configuration fails closed;
- raw S2/S3/unknown/S4 and surviving secret-bearing content make zero external
  adapter calls;
- a current, secret-free effective S0/S1 derivative from an S4 source follows the
  same eligibility rules as other effective S0/S1 derivatives;
- final effective S2/S3 derivative makes zero external adapter calls even after
  human confirmation input;
- a model-backed sanitizer uses `run_ai_task`, an explicit local route, and its own
  `ai_jobs` row; removing that spine call makes a test fail;
- a strictly deterministic non-model sanitizer makes no AI call and records that
  provenance explicitly;
- automatic derivative preserves source digest and sanitizer provenance;
- default weekly 5% sampling is deterministic and auditable;
- sampled rejection revokes and blocks derivative reuse;
- S2/S3/unknown-derived count and size caps apply before serialization;
- client mutation of text, route, target, token, digest, or confirmation fails;
- projected daily/monthly/provider limits are checked before every attempt;
- monthly hard budget and surviving S4/secret content cannot be overridden;
- expired, stale, revoked, mismatched, and consumed tickets make zero calls;
- one confirmation is consumed exactly once, including after provider error;
- fallbacks receive independent packet, trigger, credential, and economic checks;
- removing the external-egress hook from the shared spine makes an integration test
  fail;
- ledger rows contain only safe metadata and deterministic reason codes;
- existing provider, Auto, context, MemoryStore, BLUECAD, Ruff, and full backend
  suites remain green.

## Stop conditions

Stop and amend rather than weaken this definition if:

- the 059b implementation contract cannot remain consistent with accepted ADR-059
  and merged 059a;
- exact content cannot be digest-bound;
- selection and eligibility cannot share a coherent authority snapshot;
- raw S2/S3/S4/unknown, surviving secret-bearing content, or final effective S2/S3
  must enter an external packet;
- a model-backed sanitizer can bypass `run_ai_task` or `ai_jobs`;
- sanitizer provenance cannot be preserved;
- silent allow can occur above S1;
- trigger, cap, or sampling policy must be scattered code constants;
- a fallback can reuse an unbound decision;
- client-supplied outbound text, route, provider, token, or confirmation must be
  trusted;
- a provider can bypass the shared execution spine;
- hard-budget or surviving-secret denial must become confirmable;
- the design requires a second gateway, AI execution spine, MemoryStore,
  sensitivity store, vector database, worker, streaming layer, DAG orchestrator,
  external-tool runtime, or frontend redesign.

## Non-goals

- No modification or reopening of merged 059a runtime.
- No policy-autopilot runtime activation or real external execution before the
  promoted 059b implementation is reviewed and merged.
- No claim that deterministic scans prove semantic IP removal.
- No surviving-secret or final-S2/S3 confirmation override.
- No provider/model addition or live-provider test.
- No vector retrieval, conversation runtime, worker process, SSE streaming, or DAG
  orchestration.
- No external-tool execution runtime.
- No automatic canonical record promotion.
- No encryption-at-rest or forensic secure-delete claim.
- No local CAD, mesh, FEM, runner, or engineering-authority change.
